# VanHack Applicant Tracking System (VHATS)

The VanHack ATS is an enterprise application for tracking, managing and streamlining the candidate recruitment process. This project is open sourced, developed and maintained by members of the [VanHack](http://www.vanhack.com) community.

The idea here is to create an open source system to show companies the power of VanHackers!
