# VanHack Applicant Tracking System (VHATS)

The VanHack ATS is an enterprise application for tracking, managing and streamlining the candidate recruitment process. This project is open sourced, developed and maintained by members of the [VanHack](http://www.vanhack.com) community.

The idea here is to create an open source system to show companies the power of VanHackers!

## Technologies

In common agreement, the technology stack for developing this project prioritizes the technology stack in use by the VanHack team. All technologies chosen would be supported by its stack.

### Backend Technologies

The solution will be divided into different parts; the fontend and the backend providing REST API. Considering VanHack's partnership with Microsoft and that .NET Core is a general purpose, modular, cross-platform and open source implementation of the .NET Standard, the backend part will be developed using *.NET Core MVC*.

For more details, see [Define back-end technology #1](https://github.com/vanhack-technologies-inc/ats/issues/1)

### Frontend Technologies

The frontend portion will connect the final user with the proper APIs through its Web UI. Basically, *ReactJS* was chosen considering its vast popularity as a robust frontend framework also used by the VanHack team.
